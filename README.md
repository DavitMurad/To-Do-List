# To-Do-List
Yes... another to-do app. But before you roll your eyes, this one had a purpose(at least for me).
This project is a small scaled yet comprehensive revisit of my SwiftUI and MVVM fundamentals. I built it as a focused exercise to consolidate what I have recently been exploring: clean architecture, reactive design patterns, and local data persistence.

This project showcases:

Practical implementation of MVVM architecture using @StateObject, @ObservedObject, and @EnvironmentObject

UserDefaults-based local storage for lightweight and fast data persistence

Declarative UI building with SwiftUI, including custom row views, interactive toolbars, swipe actions, and context menus

An animated empty-state view with a touch of personality

Property wrapper fluency through real-world use of @State, @Published, and @Environment

A Codable item model to ensure clean state updates and serialization

User-friendly UX additions like task title validation, visual highlighting, completion toggles, and custom styling

Readable, well-structured code with scalability and reusability in mind

The goal here was not to reinvent on the concept of a task manager. It was to take something familiar and use it as a controlled playground for applying concepts I havee been sharpening recently. This includes animations, reactive updates, and making SwiftUI advanced concepts directly applicable in the appropritate enivornment

Appreciate the read, feel free to explore or fork the project. Don't forget to checkout my other projects. Cheers ✌️
